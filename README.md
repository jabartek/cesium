# Cesium - blazing fast C++ framework for web application development.

Cesium will be a C++ framework for frontend development. Delivering an API for DOM interactions, it will allow for writing blazing fast applications in the best language there is - C++. 

## Why creating Cesium?

With introduction of [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) to all major modern browsers, we are now enabled to deliver unheard of performance right inside the end user's device. WebAssembly can be compiled from multiple languages, of course including C and C++ (via the Emscripten toolkit). At the same time, little effort has been seen on the OSS scene when it comes to unleashing its power to the fullest extent. Cesium is an attempt to create a fully featured frontend development framework, written in C++, **for** C++ developers.

## Why use Cesium?

Because WebAssembly should be simple! With the cohesive DOM API, Cesium will allow you to create your app in the same way that any other framework does - just define the components, callbacks, data and compile your app. 

## Inspirations

Cesium is inspired and tries to accomplish simmilar result to Matteo Basso's [asm-dom](https://github.com/mbasso/asm-dom).
